# Longitudinal Analysis on Various Factors for Human Immune System

## Overview
This repository contains the research paper titled **"Longitudinal Analysis on Various Factors for Human Immune System"** authored by Younghwan Brian Cho. The study employs a Linear Mixed Model (LMM) to analyze the impact of several variables, including smoking, recreational drugs, and depression, on the CD4+ cell count in HIV-infected individuals over time. The analysis is based on data from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS).
